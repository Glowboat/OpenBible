The file is based on `OpenGNT` by Eliran Wong found [here](https://github.com/eliranwong/OpenGNT).  
More specifically, `OpenGNT.xml` is based on the following data, within the file named `OpenGNT_keyedFeatures.csv.zip`:
* The `(book/chapter/verse)` column
* The first value in each row of the `(TANTT)` column
* The last value in each row of the `(MounceGloss/TyndaleHouseGloss/OpenGNTGloss)` column
I have reformatted it into XML in `OpenGNT.xml`.
