The file is based on "`OpenGNT`" by Eliran Wong [here](https://github.com/eliranwong/OpenGNT).
More specifically, `OpenGNT.xml` is based on the following data, within the file named "`OpenGNT_keyedFeatures.csv.zip`":
* The `(book/chapter/verse)` column
* The first value in each row of the `(TANTT)` column
* The last value in each row of the `(MounceGloss/TyndaleHouseGloss/OpenGNTGloss)` column
I have reformatted it into XML in `OpenGNT.xml`.
