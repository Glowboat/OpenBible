The file is based on "`OpenHebrewBible`" by Eliran Wong [here](https://github.com/eliranwong/OpenHebrewBible).
More specifically, `OpenHB.xml` is based on the following data, within the file named "`BHSA-8-layer-interlinear.csv.zip`":
* The `(KJVverseID/book/chapter/verse)` column
* The `(BHSA)` column
* The `(extendedStrongNumber)` column
* The `(morphologyCode)` column
* The `(ETCBCgloss)` column
I have reformatted it into XML in OpenHB.xml.
