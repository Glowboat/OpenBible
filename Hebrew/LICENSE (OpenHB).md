The file is based on `OpenHebrewBible` by Eliran Wong found [here](https://github.com/eliranwong/OpenHebrewBible).  
More specifically, `OpenHB.xml` is based on the following data, within the file named `BHSA-8-layer-interlinear.csv.zip`:
* The `(KJVverseID/book/chapter/verse)` column
* The `(BHSA)` column
* The `(extendedStrongNumber)` column
* The `(morphologyCode)` column
* The `(ETCBCgloss)` column
I have reformatted it into XML in `OpenHB.xml`.
